PFC Focus Mode (test focus) Methodology

Focus mode makes a user specified sequence of focus images on a single image frame. Set the required image sub-frame with detpars, and the parameters shown below with obspars. Make the observation with the command "test" (or "observe") and respond to the prompt for the image type with "focus".

(foctype=           instrument) Type of focus to use
nfexpo  =                    7  Number of focus exposures
shtype  =             detector  Shift type
focmode =                 auto  Focus mode
fstart  =                @-600  Starting focus value
fdelta  =                 +200  Focus increment
nrvrows =                   20  Number of rows to reverse shift
Then, with the parameters shown above as an example, an image frame will be taken with (nfexpo=) 7 images of each object. The first six images will be separated by (nrvrows=) 20 rows and the 7th image will be (2 x nrvrows=) 40 rows from the 6th image to mark the end of the sequence. The focus setting for the first image is @-600 (from fstart) and the focus is changed by +200 (from fdelta) for each subsequent image. That is, the 7 images of each star have focus values of @-600, @-400, @-200, @0, @200, @400, and @600. Use an IRAF tool such as imexamine to determine the FWHM for the stars in several sequences to determine the best focus.

The parameters "fstart" and "fdelta" are focus control language commands that are issued to instrpars.instrfocus. In practice, "fstart" will be one of "@n", "+n", or "-n", and "fdelta" will be one of "+n" and "-n". If "nrvrows" is negative, the shift between integrations is a forward rather than reverse shift.

N.B. after a focus frame is taken, the focus setting remains at that of the last integration in the sequence (@600 in the example). If that is not the desired setting, you must use instrpars to set the focus to the desired setting.

Tip: choose a focus field away from the galactic plane to avoid crowding.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you have not already done so, constrain the detector read area by the
following procedure:
With the cursor in the ICEX window type "detp" and enter "800" in
the "firstro=" parameter line and "1200" in the "lastrow=" parameter
line. Save the detector parameters.
This will reduce the time required to read out the detector during the
focusing procedure.
To start the focus procedure, in the 'icex' window type "instrp" and enter "h"
in the "instrfo=" parameter line to home (zero) the focus offset and start the
focus servo system. Save the parameters with Ctrl-d, then type "instru".
Note that all focus adjustments are made in a relative sense, hence this first
step sets a zero position at the start of the focus sequence.
Type "test" and select the focus option. A 10 second integration is
usually sufficient for focusing. The focus routine generates seven separate
images for each star. The usual focus offset values are set to -900, -600,
-300, 0, 300, 600, 900. This is accomplished in obspars with values
of nfexpo=7, fstart = "@-900", fdelta = "+300". In the resulting
focus image in the 'ximtool' or 'ds9' window, the last star image (for +900) is
separated from the rest of the sequence.

A VERY IMPORTANT LAST STEP: edit "instrp" again, enter "h" in the
"instrfo=" parameter line. This last step is very important, since it is "telling"
ICE where the current best focus position is. All subsequent moves
performed by ice, whether from filter change or temperature change, are
made relative to this position.
Very Important Summary of this Procesdure:
The following command sequence illustrates the iterative process for
focusing the instrument/detector:
intrp->instrfocus->h
instrument
instrp->instrfocus->@[+/-]nsteps
instrument
instrp->instrfocus->hinstrument
instrp->instrfocus->@[+/-]nsteps
instrument
instrp->instrfocus->h
instrument
...
The autofocus mechanism must be turned 'on' (the initial instrp->instrfocus-
>h + instrument command);
The focus mechanism gets moved in the indicated direction (+ or â€“ nsteps),
(the instrp->instrfocus->@[+/-]nsteps + instrument command);
Then the focus mechanism is 're-homed' at the new position (the instrp-
>instrfocus->h + instrument command).
The summary illustrates the iterative sequence of turning 'on' the autofocus
mechanism, moving the focus mechanism some number of steps, and
'homing' the focus mechanism after each move. This sequence is important,
as missing or skipping a step leaves the autofocus mechanism in an
indeterminate state, which will result in a dramatic, and difficult-to-correct
out-of-focus condition.
Generally, you will repeat this sequence several times. Type "test" to take
another focus frame, and repeat until you are satisfied with the focus. (The
best attainable focus with the PFC is 1.5 pixels.)
If for any reason ICE stopped running (power outage, or hitting ^C), you
need to log into ICE again and reinitialize the PFC. The filter is where it was
before, you just have to tell it using instrp. You can also recover the focus by
typing "l" in the instfo parameter line, use instru to implement it, then go
again to instrp, type "h" on the instfo line, execute instru for starting auto-
focusing.
When finished with the calibration, focus and pointing exposures edit the
detpar file to restore the default 1 st and last row values for the detector.
